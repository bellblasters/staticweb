                                    <b>Brief Summary:</b><br />
                                    Bell Blasters won the toss on an overcast morning and sent CSU Rams to bat during
                                    their second league match of the tournament. CSU Ram had a steady start and scored
                                    20 for the loss of one wicket in the power play. Bell Blasters were a little sloppy
                                    in the field and dropped couple of catches. CSU Rams kept loosing wickets at regular
                                    intervals and were 57/3 at half way stage. Nishath, Gautam and Bhushan chipped in
                                    with a wicket each. Rajesh GK (25), Sagar (26), Girish (23) contributed to the cause
                                    and got Rams to the respectable total of 129 at the end of their 20 overs quota.
                                    Bell Blasters ended up giving 15-20 extra runs due to loose balls and sloppy
                                    fielding. Bell Blasters started with Shankar and Vinod and it was all Vinod who
                                    stole the show. He was in aggressive mode right from ball 1 and scored 21 (11)
                                    during power play. He smashed Sagar all over the park and they just had Srinivas who
                                    could control the run leakage. Shankar got out for 5 in the third over against a
                                    good diving catch from Aditya. Nishath joined Vinod and with his great form from
                                    first match. They had a decent run a ball partnership of 17 runs before Nishanth was
                                    caught at point. Ravi joined Vinod and gave a good support of 8 runs with a glorious
                                    cover drive boundary under his belt. Vinod kept smashing around the park and both
                                    added 21 in 3 overs. It was hard to keep up with Vinod\'s running between the
                                    wickets and Ravi was run out for 8 in the 9th over. Kiran who wasnt 100% fit joined
                                    Vinod. At the end of 10th over, Bell Blaster required run a ball and they were going
                                    at the required rate before Vinod teared apart Sridhar for 29 runs in 15th over. The
                                    match was done and dusted and Bell Blasters won the match in 17th over with 7
                                    wickets in hand. Vinod was adjudged man of the match for his aggressive unbeaten
                                    knock of 82 runs in 48 balls (7 fours and 5 sixes).
