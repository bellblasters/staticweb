                                        Bell Blasters - The Colorado Cricket Enthusiasts played their 1st match of CTCL 2019 - T16 at Denver on last Sunday against Sunrisers. These teams faced each other in the past twice and Bell Blasters were victorious at both occasions. Bell Blasters lost their few key players from last season, but they added some young blood in the squad and they were ready to go for a kill against Sunrisers. Sunrisers won the toss and decided to bat first. Their openers had no answer to Bell Blasters' opening bowlers - Tamim and Ravi Teja. Rav Teja and Tamim grabbed 3 quick wickets and Sunrisers were struggling at 14/3 after mandatory power play of 4 overs. Bell Blasters' veteran fast bowler Gautam Trivedi came to the attack and picked up 3 wickets in single over and Sunrisers were 15/6. After that Sunrisers were playing for survival and Nikhil and Shiva were showing some resistance to reach a respectable total. Finally Sunrisers managed to score 74/9 in 16 overs. Gautam grabbed 4 wickets, Ravi Teja 2 wickets and 1 each for Tamim and Sathpathy. In reply Blasters started their run chase with a bang when Shailendra Ambani hooked one for 4 in the first over. But soon after that he went for an expensive drive out side the off and only managed to give a simple dolly to Sunrisers wicket keeper 4 (3). It was very windy and Sunriser's bowlers were looking for couple of wickets. But sensible batting from Shankar U 18 of 24 balls (1X6, 1X4)  and Ravi Teja 6 of 15 (0X4, 0X6) prevented Blasters to do any further damage. Unfortunately Ravi Teja was mankaded by Shiva and a poor decision from umpire sent Shankar home judging him caught behind. There was a clear day light between ball and bat. Later Bhushan 2 (3) came to crease and went for an expensive slog to throw his wicket. Bell Blasters were 4 down and couple of wickets at that time could turn the table. But Sunrisers lacked better bowling options in middle overs and Tamim scored a run a ball 27* (2X4, 1X6) to chase the score comfortably. Deba was not out at 4*(5). Gautam Trivedi was judged MoM for his amazing spell of swing bowling (4-0-22-4). Special mention: Shankar U (wk) took 5 catches.
